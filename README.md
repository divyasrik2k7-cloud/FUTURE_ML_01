This project demonstrates an end-to-end retail sales forecasting system that uses time-series forecasting techniques in Python and a fully interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize historical trends, seasonality, and future predictions.

Project Overview

Retail businesses depend heavily on accurate demand forecasting.
In this project, I built an AI-based forecasting model using Facebook Prophet and created a Power BI dashboard that visualizes:
